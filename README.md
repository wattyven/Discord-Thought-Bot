## Setup

Install python 3 (recommended: 3.12+) + dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
Set up your bot token and output channel ID in `.env`

Run bot (`py3 main.py` or `python3 main.py` or `py main.py` depending on how you've set up your python install)

I recommend hosting the bot somewhere such as Oracle free tier so it's always up-to-date with the latest messages sent and you don't have to fire it up and rescan all the time. 


## Commands

I was going to list them out but got lazy. You can send `!help` to get them from the bot.

Maybe I'll change it to slash commands later.



This started off as a joke but it wound up becoming reality. yippee
